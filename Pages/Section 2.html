		<h1>Reporting-In</h1>
        
        <h2>Welcome Packet and Sponsor Assignment</h2>
        
        <p>Prior to your first day with 6 SOPS, you should have received a Welcome Packet from the squadron. In this packet will be 
        a letter from the commander welcoming you to the squadron, a memo informing you who your sponsor/supervisor will be, and 
        a link to this hankbook, or a copy of this handbook. </p>

        <p>During your initial entry into the squadron, your sponsor will be your primary point of contact to help you in-process and 
        find your way into the squadron. Typically, your sponsor will also be your supervisor. </p>

        <p>This leadership team will help guide and support you, 24/7, while you settle in to being a member of 6 SOPS. Please feel 
        free to contact them at any time if you should need help with anything, but as with any reporting list in the military, 
        please start with your supervisor first.</p>
        
        <h2>First Day with 6 SOPS</h2>

        <h3>Meeting on the First Day</h3>

        <p>Two of the main items that need to be taken care of as soon as possible are acquiring your Restricted Area (RA) access badge 
        and your Command Access Card (CAC), also known as your “ID Card”.  Both of these items are issued by offices within our active 
        duty host unit on base, which means that you will have to coordinate with your sponsor/supervisor to come out to base one day 
        during the week as the badging office and the CAC issuing facility are not open on weekends. Your first day with 6 SOPS, 
        at a minimum, will consist of getting these two forms of identification issued.  </p>
        
        <p>If you are new to the Reserves (i.e. not prior service), this day will probably not occur until after you have completed 
        Basic Military Training (for enlisted members), Officers Training School, and your basic mission qualification training.  
        However, there may be the chance that you have to spend some time with 6 SOPS before going to training, so you may end up 
        getting these items issued to you before-hand.  </p>

        <h3>Your Restricted Area (RA) Badge</h3>

        <p>This first day will start with your sponsor/supervisor meeting you at the Visitor Center just outside the North Gate of 
        Schriever Air Force Base to help you get your RA badge made and issued. Directions to the Visitor Center follow later in this 
        section.  With this RA badge, you will gain access into the area where the squadron administration and operations areas are, 
        as well as other areas such as the 310th Space Group headquarters building.  The badging process is conducted by our active 
        duty host security forces squadron.  </p>
        
        <h3>Your Common Access Card (CAC)</h3>

        <p>Additionally, if not already accomplished, your sponsor/supervisor will escort you on to base and take you to the Active 
        Duty Military Personnel Flight (MPF) office to get your CAC. Along with your RA badge, your CAC is at the heart of everything 
        we do in the Air Force and the Reserves to include accessing our military email, on-line training, and even getting into places 
        like the base gym! Please ensure that you bring a copy of your 6 SOPS orders, any previously issued CAC, and your driver’s 
        license or state issued identification card with you.</p>
        
        <p>If you have been previously been issued a CAC, you will have to turn in this CAC and have a new one made. This is because 
        access certifications must be applied to your CAC to gain access to military email, etc. specific to Schriever Air Force 
        Base. New certifications cannot be loaded onto an older CAC, or a CAC issued on a different military installation.   </p>
        
        <h2>Directions to the Schriever Air Force Base Visitor Center</h2>
        
        <p>Schriever Air Force Base is located approximately 10 miles east of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Directions to the Visitor Center 
        from I-25 in Colorado Springs are as follows:

        <p>The 6h Space Operations Squadron (6 SOPS) operationally supports Space Delta 2, Detachment 1 (formerly 50th Operations Group, Detachment 1, 
            50th Space Wing) and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) as a satellite command and control center responsible for backing up the 
            National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, Suitland, Md. Administrative control resides with 10th Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and 
            subsequently the 310th Operations Group, 310th Space Wing at the Peterson-Schriever Garrison, Colorado (formerly Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado). 
		</p>

        <p>Even though the United States Space Force stood up in 2019, 6 SOPS (as well as all other units under the 310th Space Wing) is still a part of 
            Air Force Reserve Command until a Reserve component of the Space Force is established.</p>
		
        <p>The unit has a 24/7/365 recall capability that is tasked to provide unassisted command and control of the DMSP constellation within one 
            hour's notice during duty hours (hot backup) and three hours’ notice during off-duty hours (warm backup), and to sustain the mission indefinitely 
            as required.  This rapid response ensures that warfighters have the timeliest environmental data, day or night.  </p>

        <p>6 SOPS’ mission comes is comprised of four parts: capture, deliver, timeliest, and environmental intelligence.
            •	Capture: contacting satellites and playing down recorded environmental intelligence data
            •	Deliver: forwarding data to our users – 557 Weather Wing at Offutt AFB in Nebraska, and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Oceanography Center 
            in California
            •	Timeliest: 10 min requirement for primary data
            •	Environmental Intelligence: includes data on air, land, sea, and space environments, information which can help determine cloud type and 
            height, land and surface water temperatures, water currents, ocean surface features, and locations of snow and ice.
            </p>

        <h1>A Brief History of 6 SOPS</h1>

        <p>The organization known today as the 6th Space Operations Squadron was initially activated as the 4000th Support Group in February 1963, under 
            Headquarters Strategic Air Command, both located at Offutt Air Force Base, NE. In January 1966, the group was reassigned to the 1st Strategic 
            Aerospace Division, Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA. Later that same year, a Vandenberg launch ushered the first Block 4 class of meteorological 
            satellite into the inventory. In January 1973, the group was re-designated the 4000th Aerospace Applications Group and in April 1981, it was again  
            renamed the 4000th Satellite Operations Group. On May 1, 1983, the group was transferred to the newly formed Air Force Space Command under the 1st 
            Space Wing and was designated the 1000th Satellite Operations Group or "One Grand." The "One Grand" was then moved under the 2nd Space Wing in 1985. 
            In 1992, the 1000 SOG was designated as a squadron, and renamed 6 SOPS.</p>

        <p>On May 5, 1994, President William Clinton directed convergence of the DMSP program with the civilian weather satellite programs operated by the Department 
            of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In April 1998, NOAA was granted operational control of the DMSP program as the primary 
            facility, and 6 SOPS, located at Offutt Air Force Base, became the backup facility. In June 1998, 6 SOPS ceased operations, temporarily leaving DMSP 
            without a backup command and control agency. 6 SOPS was deactivated as an active-duty unit on Sept. 30, 1998, and was reactivated as a Reserve unit located 
            at Schriever Air Force Base the following day. In January 1999, the 6 SOPS Schriever facility was declared operational as the DSMP backup facility. In March 
            2018, 6 SOPS (as a Reserve unit) completed its 40,000 DMSP satellite contact.</p>

        <h1>6 SOPS Manning Structure</h1>

        <p>6 SOPS is an Air Force Reserve Command unit that provides support for the United States Space Force. 6 SOPS has no active duty/Regular Air Force (RegAF) 
            operational counterpart and maintains mission operations with fifteen full-time/Active Guard Reserve (AGR) members and twenty-one traditional reservists 
            (TRs). This reserve force blend allows 6 SOPS to complete the mission at a reduced cost.</p>

        <p>6 SOPS consists of five different flights that allow for the accomplishment of our mission:</p>

            <p>•	DOU: Crew Force Management Flight
                o	The mission of the Crew Force Management flight (DOU) is to manage squadron crew manning requirements necessary to accomplish the 6 SOPS part of 
                the DMSP mission.  The DOU flight ensures that command and control (C2) and mission execution is accomplished by maintaining crew manning schedules.  
                DOU is integral in the oversight of operations and optimization of mission execution in support of DoD and NOAA taskings. </p>

            <p>•	DOK: Weapons and Tactics Flight
                o	The Weapons and Tactics flight, or DOK, works closely with Wing level tactical experts to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) 
                specific to the DMSP mission in order to counter the threats from a contested, degraded, and operationally limited (CDO) space environment.  With this 
                tactical knowledge, DOK (working in conjunction with the Training flight (DOT) and the Standardization and Evaluations flight (DOV)), develops advanced 
                TTP and CDO training materials and scenarios used to educate 6 SOPS DMSP operators.</p>

            <p>•	DOT: Training Flight
                o	The Training flight (DOT) is the heart of all mission and instructor certification training within the squadron.  DOT provides the instructors 
                needed to execute DMSP mission certification training.   DOT is also responsible for identifying future instructors and ensuring that those identified 
                receive the necessary training to become an instructor.  Additionally, DOT reviews, updates, and maintains all training materials associated with 
                mission certification training and tracks student progress until they are mission certified.</p>

            <p>•	DOV: Standardization and Evaluations Flight
                o	The DMSP mission would not be effective without the help of the Standardization and Evaluations flight, or DOV.  As the name of the flight 
                suggests, DOV oversees and ensures adherence to operational standards by the operators.  DOV is responsible for the tracking of operator certifications 
                and works with the Operations Group’s Evaluation shop to schedule recurring operator evaluations.  Additionally, DOV maintains a technical order and 
                procedure update process which is used to update DMSP operations, training, and evaluations materials. </p>

            <p>•	DOO:  Current Operations Flight
                o	A 6 SOPS member’s journey will start in the Current Operations, or DOO, flight.  DOO oversees the administrative care of all new members of 6 SOPS, 
                providing a home for them as they become a part of DMSP.  All new members of 6 SOPS will remain a part of DOO from the moment they are assigned to the 
                squadron, all the way through mission qualification training and their first certification evaluation, providing them with the tools needed to be 
                successful once assigned to one of the other flights. </p>

        <h1>The DMSP Satellite Constellation</h1>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="C:\Users\1121699881V\OneDrive - United States Air Force\Personal Part 5\Project\Pages\S2 DMSP.jpg" alt="DMSP Image" width="550" height="400"></p> 

        <p>The first DMSP satellite, known at that time as the Defense Satellite Applications Program (DSAP), was launched in 1962. DMSP was initially classified and 
            run by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in support of the CORONA program. CORONA satellites had limited film onboard, and it was essential to have 
            timely and accurate weather forecasts to ensure cloud-free pictures were taken of high-interest areas. DMSP data is also critical to the forecast process. 
            Declassified in 1972, DMSP data was made available to civilian and scientific user communities.</p>
            
        <p>In May 1994, the President directed the Departments of Defense and Commerce (DOC) and DOD to converge their separate polar-orbiting weather satellite 
            programs. A tri-agency organization consisting of the DOC, DOD and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was formed. As part of the 
            convergence plan, DMSP operations were transferred from the DOD to the DOC in June 1998, with funding responsibility remaining with the US Air Force. 
            Satellite operations were moved to Suitland, Maryland, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Satellite and Product 
            Operations (OSPO) provides the command, control and communications for DMSP, Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES), Geostationary Operational 
            Environmental Satellite (GOES), Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and others. Satellite Control Authority (SCA) resides with 50th Operations Group, 
            Detachment 1, located at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility, for oversight of the DMSP constellation. Backup operations are performed by the 6th 
            Space Operations Squadron (SOPS) at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado.  DMSP continues to provide assured, secure, global environmental sensing data 
            to support the warfighter.</p>

        <p>DMSP spacecraft have the ability to store data onboard as well as transmit data directly to ground terminals. Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) 
            sites are used to retrieve stored data and electronically transfer the data to the Air Combat Command’s 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base, 
            Nebraska. NOAA and NASA sites at Fairbanks, Alaska, and McMurdo, Antarctica also support DMSP stored data distribution to users. DOD deployed tactical 
            systems can receive direct broadcast of data when in the field of view of the satellite.</p>

        <p>DMSP space vehicles and sensors were developed and acquired by the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles AFB, California.</p>

        <p>The 310th Operations Group was reactivated on March 7, 2008. While the 310th Space Wing traces its heritage directly to the 310th Bombardment 
            Group (Medium) and the Doolittle Raiders, who founded that organization in 1942, the Wing did not have a dedicated Operations Group until the Air 
            Force implemented the Objective Wing Structure following the Gulf War. Activated under the then-310th Training and Test Wing at Vandenberg AFB, 
            California in 1991, the 310th Operations Group conducted Follow-on Test and Evaluation launches of Minuteman III and Peacekeeper ICBMs and supported 
            the education and training of ICBM Missile Combat Crewmen. The Group stood down with its Wing in 1993. The Wing was reactivated as the 310th Space 
            Group in 1997 and, with its re-designation as a Wing in 2008, the 310th Operations Group was reactivated.</p>
